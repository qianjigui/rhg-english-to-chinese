some diagrams may be missing and some sentences may be a little
rough. But it also means they are in open review, so do not hesitate

h1. About this Guide

This is a new effort to gather efforts to help translate
"Ruby Hacking Guide":http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/book/ into English.

The official support site of the original book is
http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/

You can download the version of the source code explained and
the tool used in the book
from the official support site of the original book.
* "ruby (1.7.3 2002-09-12) in tar.gz format":http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/ar/ruby-rhg.tar.gz
* "ruby (1.7.3 2002-09-12) in zip format":http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/ar/ruby-rhg.zip
* "Pragmatic Programmers' nodeDump 0.1.7":http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/ar/nodeDump-0.1.7.tgz
* "RHG-version nodedump":http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/ar/nodedump-rhg.tar.gz

The original translating project is hosted at RubyForge
http://rubyforge.org/projects/rhg

Many thanks to "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org for hosting us and to
Minero AOKI for letting us translate his work.

You can get further information about this project from
"the archives of rhg-discussion mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rhg-discussion/


h2. Help us!

People who are good at Ruby, C and Japanese or English are
needed. Those good at Japanese (native Japanese speakers are of course
welcome) can help translate and those good at English (preferably
native speakers) can help correct mistakes, and rewrite badly written
parts... Knowing Ruby and C well is really a requirement because it
helps avoiding many mistranslations and misinterpretations.

People good at making diagrams would also be helpful because there is
quite a lot to redo and translators would rather spend their time
translating instead of making diagrams.

There have been multiple efforts to translate this book, and we want to see if
we can renew efforts by creating an organisation on github. Interested parties
can join in by starting a pull request on this repo
https://github.com/ruby-hacking-guide/ruby-hacking-guide.github.com
There is a mostly derelict mailing list at
"rhg-discussion mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/rhg-discussion
feel free to introduce yourself (who you are, your skills, how much free time you
have), but we think the best way to propose or send corrections/improvements
is to send a pull request. If you start a feature branch along with a pull
request at the start of your work then people can comment as you work.

There is an old SVN repo, that is hosted at
The RubyForge project page is http://rubyforge.org/projects/rhg.
It has been imported here, and I will attempt to give credit and re-write the
SVN/Git history when I can.

As for now the contributors to that repo were:

* Vincent ISAMBART
* meinrad recheis
* Laurent Sansonetti
* Clifford Caoile
* Jean-Denis Vauguet
